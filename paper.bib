abstract = {Effective hydrogen storage solutions have been pursued for decades, and materials-based hydrogen storage is a research frontier of much current interest. Yet, no researched materials to date have come close to the DOE 2020 targets for hydrogen storage at ambient conditions, although some good results have been reported at cryogenic temperature. This paper critically reviews the current research trends and perspectives on materials-based hydrogen storage including both materials-based physical storage and materials-based chemical storage. In the case of physical storage, the efforts on exploring new porous materials with extra larger surface/pore volume, inducing hydrogen spillover effect, and tailoring reaction enthalpies are discussed. Meanwhile, for chemical storage, approaches to improve the kinetics and/or thermodynamics such as the development of composite hydride systems, nanoconfinement of hydride materials as well as the usage of ionic liquids as hydrogen storage materials or useful additives are discussed. Furthermore, the applied techniques on solid-state materials towards system integration such as shaping and electrospinning processes are introduced. Finally, the concept of storing hydrogen in para form for long-term hydrogen storage is discussed, and a converter packed with catalysts to process the normal hydrogen to para-hydrogen is highlighted.}

@article{osti_1777267,
title = {Tritium Transport Phenomena in Molten-Salt Reactors},
author = {Humrickhouse, Paul W and Fuerst, Thomas F},
abstractNote = {In this work, we review phenomena relevant to tritium transport in molten-salt reactors, which produce tritium from lithium and beryllium salts at significantly higher levels than other reactor types. Modeling of such phenomena began following MSRE operations, and these early models attempted to predict measured tritium distributions in the MSRE, accounting for turbulent mass-transport processes (using established heat transfer correlations), permeation through a variety of metal structures such as heat exchanger tubes, and transport to and from bubbles introduced into the salt by gas sparging. The models reasonably reproduced the MSRE data, but did so best when the permeability of structures was reduced by about a factor of 1,000. This issue does not appear to have been conclusively resolved, and all of the more recent attempts to model tritium transport in molten salts appear to make use of the same methodology. MSRE remains, however, essentially our only source of integral tritium transport data relevant to MSRs. Here, we generalize the MSRE approach to permeation in order to include potential rate-limiting effects at interfaces, as well the effects of added hydrogen. Appropriately non-dimensionalized, this system of equations identifies two dimensionless numbers whose relative values clearly delineate the conditions under which mass transport, surface effects, permeation, and hydrogen swamping are expected to become rate-limiting. We also describe the preliminary conceptual design of a forced convection FLiBe loop, into which tritium would be introduced for the purpose of providing validation data for such a model. The primary purpose of this is to investigate the coupled transport phenomena described above and identify those that are rate-limiting in MSRs. Additional test section configurations are described that would address other transport phenomena relevant to MSRs, including bubbly flows and graphite interactions.},
