	abstract = {Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Because it is radioactive, its release to the environment must be minimized. Most of the materials used in fusion reactors are metals that have a relatively high permeability for tritium. The fusion community has been working on barrier materials to minimize tritium release by permeation through structural materials. Unfortunately, most barrier materials work very well during laboratory experiments, but fail to meet requirements when placed in radiation environments. This chapter presents tritium permeation characteristics of various materials used in fusion reactors, including plasma-facing, structural, and barrier materials. The parameters necessary for tritium release calculations for various regions of a fusion reactor are given.},

	abstract = {With the method of gas-driven permeation, a series of permeation experiments was carried out using Hastelloy N alloy membrane in an elevated temperature range of 400°C to 800°C with different hydrogen isotopes. A complete set of permeability, diffusivity, and Sieverts’ constant for hydrogen and deuterium in Hastelloy N alloy was successfully obtained. The isotope effect in the diffusion process was analyzed and compared with references. The ratios of diffusive transport parameters for hydrogen and deuterium were a permeability ratio of ФH/ФD = 1.32exp(0.34kJ/RT), a diffusivity ratio of DH/DD = 1.15exp(−0.41kJ/RT), and a Sieverts’ constant ratio of KS,H/KS,D = 1.16exp(0.21kJ/RT). The result that the permeation flux of deuterium was decreased after introducing hydrogen could be used to suppress the permeation of tritium in future tritium control of the Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR). Compared with NiO, the Cr2O3 formed in the surface oxidation layer of Hastelloy N alloy showed better hydrogen permeation barrier performance after baking above 700°C in air.},

Measurements of deuterium transport were made in a cylindrically symmetric, dual permeation probe assembly containing 400 cc of Flibe. An exact analytical transport solution in cylindrical coordinates was fit to the measured permeation data, and this analysis derived deuterium diffusion and solubility coefficients of 8.0×10−10 m2/s and 3.1×10−4 mol/m3Pa at 600 °C, respectively, and 3.0×10−9 m2/s and 1.0×10−4 mol/m3Pa at 650 °C. The diffusion coefficients were about a factor of two less than previous results derived from capillary-reservoir diffusion measurements with tritium. Solubility results were significantly greater than previously measured for D2 but they were comparable to those for DF in Flibe. The results suggest that the dominant deuterium transport species in Flibe was D+F− for these experiments.},

This paper reports on laboratory-scale studies with 3 keV D+3 ion beams to investigate the hydrogen transport behavior in tungsten coatings on substrates of copper. These experiments entailed measurements of the deuterium re-emission and permeation rates for tungsten, copper, and tungsten-coated copper specimens at temperatures ranging from 638 to 825 K and implanting particle fluxes of approximately 5 × 1019 D/m2 s. Diffusion constants and surface recombination coefficients with enhancement factors due to sputtering were obtained from these measurements. These data may be used in calculations to estimate permeation rates and inventory buildups for proposed diverter designs.},

	title = {Self-diffusion and impurity diffusion of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus in copper},
	abstract = {A study on the mobility of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus in copper has been made.
In addition, the self-diffusion of copper has also been studied. Literature data has been reviewed,
and used to evaluate the temperature expressions of the diffusion coefficients of these elements in
copper. The interstitial elements oxygen and hydrogen have been described by a single temperature
expression in the whole temperature range, whereas the substitutional elements copper, sulphur,
and phosphorus have been modelled according to lattice diffusion at high temperatures and grain
boundary diffusion at low temperatures.
Sulphur, phosphorus, and copper are believed to be nearly immobile within the crystalline grains
at low temperature, even for time periods up to 100,000 years. On the other hand, in the grain
boundaries these elements can diffuse and an upper limit estimate of the possible diffusion distance
has been made. At room temperature sulphur can diffuse up to 5 cm for 100,000 years, whereas both
phosphorus and copper requires more than 1,000 000 years to diffuse the same distance. The oxygen
atom shows a similar mobility, although it is interstitially diffusing through the grains. However,
since both oxygen and sulphur have a very low solubility any measureable mass transport of these
elements will never take place at low temperatures. They will instead form oxides and sulphides in
the material.
Hydrogen is a mobile element, and will be able to diffuse through 5 cm of copper during a time period
of 1,000 years at room temperature. The diffusion of hydrogen in copper is experimentally well studied
down to room temperature. By combining the evaluated hydrogen diffusion coefficient with the
thermodynamically calculated hydrogen content in solid solution the permeability of hydrogen can be
explained. This can be used to explain the mass-transport of hydrogen for different times, temperatures,
and hydrogen activities (pressures).},

              Interest in molten salts has increased significantly over the last decade due to their potential application in various clean-energy technologies including hydrogen generation, solar heat storage, advanced fission nuclear power plants, and compact fusion energy systems. In nuclear fission and fusion power plants, high heat capacity molten salts allow operation at high temperature and atmospheric pressure, which could dramatically increase efficiency, reduce capital cost, and enable passive safety features. In many of these systems, the hydrogen isotope is of particular importance due to its ability to corrode structural materials as

The diffusivities from 200K to 3000K are calculated and the diffusion equation is fitted to D=5.13×10−8exp(−0.21eV/kT)m2/s. The diffusion equations in different temperature ranges of 200–500K, 500–2400K and 2400–3000K are also given separately and the results imply different H diffusion modes in different temperature ranges, which is proved by analyzing equilibrium H positions at low and high temperatures. The H atom jumps between different tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) at lower temperatures, but the transition to octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) is also observed at high temperatures. Moreover, with a vacancy present in the W system, vacancy trapping of H is observed, and it is shown that the vacancy trapping reduces with the increasing temperature. The H binding energy to monovacancy is obtained using three different methods including NEB and fitting both H diffusivity and time for H to detrap from the vacancy, which provides more information of the H behaviors with the existence of defects.},

Descriptions on the permeability apparatus, experimental procedure and the analytical method for determining the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen isotope in molten salts were presented in this paper. To assess the performance of the apparatus, the blank tests without molten salt were conducted at 300-700 degrees C. The results showed that the nickel plate acting as the window for hydrogen isotope permeation in the apparatus seemed to have less effect on experiments of determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten slat at 500-700 degrees C. Furthermore, the applicability of the apparatus with molten salt was also evaluated experimentally, with test experiments of molten Flinak (LiF-NaF-KF) at 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C.

Here, we report results from periodic density-functional theory calculations for three crucial aspects of this interaction: surface-to-subsurface diffusion of H into W, trapping of H at vacancies, and H-enhanced decohesion, with a view to assess the likely extent of hydrogen isotope incorporation into tungsten reactor walls. We find energy barriers of (at least) 2.08 eV and 1.77 eV for H uptake (inward diffusion) into W(001) and W(110) surfaces, respectively, along with very small barriers for the reverse process (outward diffusion). Although H dissolution in defect-free bulk W is predicted to be endothermic, vacancies in bulk W are predicted to exothermically trap multiple H atoms. Furthermore, adsorbed hydrogen is predicted to greatly stabilize W surfaces such that decohesion (fracture) may result from high local H concentrations.},

This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},

The determination of the magnitude and kinetics of the tritium flux from the blanket to the helium cooling loop, along with the design of future tritium extraction systems of the breeding alloy or the He coolant purification system, will be defined on basic transport parameters such as solubility. The unacceptable scattering of Sieverts’ constant values in the historical measurements given by different experimental techniques, suggests that this is a very important and unresolved issue. In this work, it has been experimentally evaluated, using absorption and desorption techniques. The different measurement campaigns have been carried out in the temperature range from 523 to 922K and in the pressure range from 1 to 105Pa. This paper describes the work carried out in the preparation of the facility, the theoretical model developed to process the different results obtained by means of absorption and desorption runs. Final results obtained during several campaigns of measurements are provided. The obtained values of hydrogen solubility through the different campaigns show a similar value for the Sieverts’ constant, and therefore, a very little value for the activation energy in the solution process. Results are compared and discussed. The proposed correlation for hydrogen Sieverts’ constant in Pb–Li from these tests is KS [molm−3Pa−1/2]=8.64×10−3exp(–0.9/RT), R in (kJK−1mol−1).},

	abstract = {Tritium release behavior and surface tritium behavior were separately examined for typical fcc and bcc metals by using tritium tracer techniques. Pure copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) and molybdenum (Mo) were loaded with hydrogen including a trace amount of tritium and then immersed into water at around room temperatures. Then, the tritium release rate into the water was examined by a liquid scintillation counting technique and the surface tritium concentration by a tritium imaging plate technique. The tritium release from the metals is attributed to the release of dissolved tritium by diffusion from the normal interstitial sites, and the first order desorption of trapped one with detrapping energies of 64, 72 and 25kJmol−1 for Cu, Fe and Mo, respectively. Overall release behavior is varied depending on the ratio of dissolved and trapped amounts of tritium.},

	abstract = {Ion driven permeation has been investigated for Cu, Ni and Al under deuteron (30 keV) bombardment with different sample thickness, temperature, incident energy and flux. A time sequence of the permeation rate shows a spike at intermediate temperatures as seen previously, while the maximum permeation rate tends to be saturated at high temperatures. These permeation behaviors have also been observed for Al the surface of which was covered by an oxide not removed by deuteron bombardment. The saturated permeation rate (Jp) is well expressed by Jp = rφ/d (r, φandd are the range of the incident ion, the incident flux, and th e specimen thickness, respectively), which is deduced from the assumption that both the reemission and the permeation are controlled by the diffusion process. According to recombination theory, the permeation rate should be much higher because the reemission is delayed by the surface oxide or other contaminants with small recombination coefficients. Therefore the recombination theory seems not to be applicable for the estimation of the ion driven permeation with high incident energies at above 500 K as made in the present work.},

From the data on tritium residence time obtained in PH2 = 3000 Pa, the diffusion coefficient of tritium was determined as follows: D/m2s−1 = 2.50 × 10−7exp(−27.0 kJmol−1/RT), which was slightly larger than the other literature values.},

	abstract = {In the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket for DEMO the breeding material is represented by eutectic lead lithium alloy flowing in poloidal–radial direction in the breeding module. The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2. The experimental device and the obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper.},

Solubility data were recorded in the pressure range 150—20000 hPa at temperatures up to 1220 K. Alloy interactions with stainless steel containers and with oxygen impurities were investigated. The temperature and pressure dependence of the mole fraction xH of hydrogen atoms in the melt at low hydrogen concentration, where Sievert's law is valid, can be described by the following equation: ln(xH√105Pa/PH2) = - A + B/T. The values of the constants are A = 8.17, B = 734 K (LiPb); A = 7.84, B = 1970 K (Li62Pb38); A = 7.42, B = 1200 K (LiIn); A = 7.67, B = 3300 K (Li62In38); A = 7.08, B = 600 K (Li57Sn43); A = 6.86, B = 830 K (Li62Sn38). Strong deviations from Sievert's law are observed for two alloys indicating alloy decomposition. The reduction of the excess entropy of dissolved hydrogen in the alloys compared to pure lithium is discussed in the frame of an electrostatic model.},

The Sieverts' constants showed a 105-fold increase as the Pb content was increased over the stated composition range. The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead. Availability of the latter estimates permitted testing of three statistical mechanical models against the experimental data. The results were compared with other literature on the H-Li-Pb system.},

The condensable tritium component in the sweep gas was attributed to TF and the non-condensable component to HT. The isothermal release of each component was analyzed by taking into account the mass transfers and the chemical reactions in the system. It was found that the mass transfer coefficient of TF at the gas-liquid interface was much lower than that of HT. For comparison, the diffusion coefficient of tritium in a molten flibe was measured by a capillary method, and the effective film at the interface was estimated to be {\textasciitilde}1 mm thick. The isotopic exchange reaction of TF with H2 was confirmed to occur in the presence of H2, resulting in the HT production. The reduction of TF by the constituents of stainless steel might be responsible for additional production of HT.},

	abstract = {In order to estimate the fuel loss in ITER and further future fusion devices, the deuterium permeation through different wall and structural materials are studied. In order to determine the effective permeability, gas-driven deuterium permeation measurements are performed on Cu and ITER grade CuCrZr. The obtained permeabilites for Cu and ITER grade CuCrZr are very similar and in agreement to literature values for Cu. For a better estimation for fusion reactor components, combined material samples are studied. Cu layers were applied on steel substrates by magnetron sputter deposition. With these studies, the influence of interfaces and microstructure on the hydrogen permeation is investigated. Our study reveals that in the case of Cu layered steel substrates the influence of the interface on the permeation flux is minor compared to the influence of the microstructure on the permeability. The Cu layer permeability is around one order of magnitude smaller than the Cu bulk permeability in the temperature range between 300∘C and 550∘C.},

In the present study, a series of hydrogen and deuterium permeation experiments was performed for ferritic F82H steel with and without a ceramic coating of Cr2O3–SiO2 including CrPO4. First, experiments were made on the permeability of F82H steel without coating at 300–600°C in an atmosphere of 100–1000Pa hydrogen and deuterium. The measured values of diffusion coefficient, permeability and solubility were in good agreement with those published previously. Next, experiments were performed on the permeability of F82H steel with the coating at 400–600°C in an atmosphere of 1000–1500Pa deuterium, and the permeation reduction factor (PRF) of the coating was determined. The obtained PRF at 600°C was about 400, which is of the same order of magnitude as the PRF value of about 1000 previously evaluated for the same coating on an SS316 substrate. A significant decrease in the PRF (down to about 4\%) was observed, when the sample temperature was lowered from 600 to 400°C.},

Measurements of the permeation rate of hydrogen and deuterium through the modified 1.4914 steel, believed to be the first made, show that the martensitic steel is significantly more permeable than the austenitic steel, by an order of magnitude at 250°C and a factor of five at 600°C.

It has been proved that this method is good for examining transient-permeation behaviors as well as steady-state permeation if the instrumental time-lag is taken into account. Diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen for the alloys are derived from the transient and steady-state permeation. The γ'-precipitation strengthened alloys — Inconel 750 and Nimonic 80A — show a larger activation energy of diffusion and a smaller solution heat than the other nickel-base alloys. This result is ascribed to the trapping effect due to titanium in the former alloys, i.e. solute titanium atoms and/or γ'-precipitations.},

	abstract = {Transient and steady state fluxes of hydrogen were measured for annealed and deformed AISI 301, 304 and 310 austenitic and annealed AL 29-4-2 ferritic stainless steel membranes using a gas phase permeation technique at T = 100–350°C. Permeability and effective diffusivity and solubility constants were calculated from these data. Up to 80\% deformation of the stable AISI 310 alloy made only a relatively small change in the transport parameters. Deformation of AISI 301 and 304 resulted in various amounts of stress-induced α′ martensite, which greatly enhanced the effective hydrogen diffusivity and permeability. The relationship between phase changes and hydrogen transport parameters was modeled using various assumptions about the microstructure. Effective solubility and diffusivity values are discussed in terms of dislocation trapping and transport.
Résumé
Nous avons mesuré les flux transitoires et stationnaires d'hydrogène dans des membranes d'aciers inoxydables austénitiques recuits et déformés AISI 301, 304 et 310 et d'acier inoxydable ferritique recuit Al 29-4-2, à l'aide d'une technique de permeation en phase gazeuse entre 100 et 350°C. A partir de ces résultats, nous avons calculé les constantes de perméabilité, de diffusivité effective et de solubilité effective. Jusqu' à 80\%, la déformation de l'alliage stable AISI 310 ne produit qu'un changement relativement petit des paramètres de transport. La déformation des alliages AISI 301 et 304 produisait diverses quantités de martensite α′ induite par la contrainte, ce qui augmentait beaucoup la diffusivité et la perméabilité de l'hydrogène. Nous avons modélisé la relation entre les changements de phases et les paramètres de transport de l'hydrogène en faisant différentes hypothèses sur la microstructure. Nous discutons les valeurs de la solubilité et de la diffusivité effectives en considérant le piègeage et le transport par les dislocations.
Zusammenfassung
Der Wasserstoff-Fluβ im Übergang und im stationären Zustand wurde an metallischen Membranen mit einer Gasphasen-Durchdringungstechnik im Temperaturbereich zwischen 100 und 350°C gemessen. Als Membranmaterial dienten ausgeheilte und verformte austenitische rostfreie Stähle AISI 301, 304, 310 und der ausgeheilte ferritische rostfreie Stahl AL 29-4-2. Aus diesen Meβdaten wurden die Permeabilität und die effectiven Diffusivitäts- und Löslichkeitskonstanten ermittelt. Bis zu einer Verformung von 80\% fand sich in dem stabilen Stahl AISI 310 nur eine relativ geringe Änderung der Transportkonstanten. Die Verformung von AISI 301 und 304 führte zu verschiedenen Mengen an spannungs-induziertem α′-Martensit, der die effektive Wasserstoffdiffusivität und -permeabilität stark erhöhte. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Phasenänderungen und Parametern des Wasserstofftransportes wurden unter verschiedenen Annahmen über die Mikrostruktur modelliert. Die Werte für effektive Löslichkeit und Diffusivität werden anhand des Einfangs an Versetzungen und des Transports entlang von Versetzungen diskutiert.},

	abstract = {A tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Because it is radioactive, its release to the environment must be minimized. Accurately predicting tritium transports in fusion materials and fusion systems heavily depend on a reliable database of hydrogen mass transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in fusion reactor materials. This article summarizes fundamental kinetics on hydrogen isotope in material and provides recommended mass transport properties (diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in materials for nuclear application.
Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Because it is radioactive, its release to the environment must be minimized. Most of the materials used in fusion reactors are metals that have a relatively high permeability for tritium. The fusion community has been working on barrier materials to minimize tritium release by permeation through structural materials. Unfortunately, most barrier materials work very well during laboratory experiments, but fail to meet requirements when placed in radiation environments.
This chapter presents tritium permeation characteristics of various materials used in fusion reactors, including plasma-facing, structural, and barrier materials. The parameters necessary for tritium release calculations for various regions of a fusion reactor are given.
One of the key requirements for the application of planar solid oxide fuel cells is the hermetical sealing of ceramic and metallic stack-components. Gas tightness and associated mechanical integrity of the sealants are therefore key prerequisites for reliable operation over the lifetime of the stack. To withstand mechanical stresses generated by the differences in thermal expansion of the involved materials as well as non-equilibrium thermal conditions upon heating and cooling, joining with metals rather than brittle glass-ceramics is considered to be advantageous. Hence, as one of the joining possibilities for SOFCs of planar design reactive air brazing of the ceramic cell into a metallic frame has gained increasing interest and proofed its suitability in several mid term full scale stack experiments at Forschungszentrum Jülich.
Fracture experiments were carried out to characterize the fracture energy and associated failure mechanisms of silver-based reactive air brazes, used for joining the zirconia electrolyte of an anode supported planar cell with a metallic Crofer22APU frame. The specimens were mechanically tested in notched beam bending geometry at room temperature. Mechanical testing was accompanied by in-situ observation with optical and SEM resolution.
Discussion of the results focuses on the influence of isothermal aging and associated interfacial reactions on crack path location and mechanical characteristics. State of the art CuO-containing brazes turned out to be outbalanced by a newly conceived CuO-free braze. The new braze did not only display superior delamination resistance in the as-brazed state, combined with an additional pre-oxidation treatment of the steel but also showed improved degradation resistance against isothermal aging.
A composite braze, consisting of Ag–Cu–Ti braze alloy and particulate Al2TiO5 filler, was used to produce metal/braze/metal and metal/braze/YSZ joints to seal and interconnect metal-supported SOFC membranes. The addition of Al2TiO5 to the braze alloy lowers the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the resulting composite sufficiently so as to produce joints in which the YSZ does not crack due to CTE mismatch. Optimization of the reactive element (Ti) loading is discussed with regard to its effect on electrolyte conductivity. Electronic conductivity, sealing ability, and strength of the braze alloy remain acceptable after complete oxidation at 700 °C in air. Joints were also tested in air/fuel dual atmosphere environment at 700 °C. After this exposure, the joint remains hermetically sealed, and no significant degradation of the joint was observed. This is in contrast to a free-standing foil of the braze alloy, which failed upon dual atmosphere exposure. The composite braze material was used to seal a metal-supported thin-film YSZ cell. The sealed cell was thermally cycled 30 times very rapidly without any deterioration of the open circuit voltage.
The surface recombination coefficients of deuterium for polycrystalline Ni, Fe, Cu, and Ag were evaluated from the flux of ion-driven permeation. These data agreed rather quantitatively with semi-theoretical estimations based on a simple consideration of equilibrium. This demonstrates that the release kinetics is dominated by the activation barrier for adsorption as well as the solubility.},

The oxidation reaction produces the very low downstream pressures that drive the flux. This method is attractive because the flux can be proportional to the square-root of upstream pressure. For fusion reactors with liquid lithium or lithium-lead alloy breeder blankets, permeation windows provide a simple, cheap tritium extraction method. Interdiffusion rates, separation flux, window size, helium contents, tritium holdup costs, and overall costs are calculated for membranes of palladium-coated zirconium, niobium, vanadium, nickel and stainless-steel. For extracting tritium from liquid lithium using the cheapest windows, Zr-Pd, the material and labor cost is 8.0 M\$ at 1 wppm, and is inversely proportional to tritium concentration in the lithium. The tritium holdup cost for the windows is 4.8 M\$, and for the blanket it is proportional to the blanket volume and concentration. An overall economic optimization suggests that 1 to 1.5 wppm in lithium is optimal. For extracting tritium from 17Li83Pb at 0.26 wppb, the cheapest window is V-Pd; the cost is 2.6 M\$, and the tritium holdup is negligible.},

Zusammenfassung
Der Diffusionskoeffizient von Wasserstoff in Zirkon, Zircaloy-2 und Zircaloy-4 wurde zwischen 275 und 700 °C bestimmt. Für die Diffusionskoeffizienten in den drei Materialien besteht kein messbarer Unterschied, auch wurde kein Einfluss der Korngrösse und Kalt Verformung beobachtet.

Die Konstanten D0 und Q der Arrhenius-Gleichung sind für die longitudinale und die Querrichtung sowie in Richtung der Probendicke 7,73 × 10−3cm2s und 10830 calmol, 5,84 × 10−3cm2s und 10290 calmol, 7,90 × 10−3cm2s und 10730 calmol.

	abstract = {The effects of alloy composition, grain size and cold work on the terminal solubility and thermodynamic activity of hydrogen in the alpha phase of zirconium, Zircaloy-2, and Zircaloy-4 were determined by a diffusion sample method. The terminal solubility for Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4 below 550°C was found to be given by 9.9 x 104 exp(− 8250/RT) ppm. The solubilities given by this function approximate those given for unalloyed zirconium by 1.61 x 105 exp(− 8950/RT) ppm which is the combined result from nine investigations. The best-fit curve for the combined data for all three materials is given by 1.2 x 105 exp(− 8550/RT). The activity of hydrogen in the alpha phase, as measured by partitioning in diffusion couples, was found to vary only slightly among the three materials in the range 329°C to 796°C. An average P-C-T relationship derived from published data for these materials is represented by CP12 = 1.4 x 10−2 exp(11840/RT) at \% mm−12.
Résumé
Les effets de la composition de l'alliage, de la taille du grain et de l'écrouissage sur la solubilité terminale et l'activité thermodynamique de l'hydrogène dans le zirconium α, le Zircaloy-2 et le Zircaloy-4 ont été déterminés par une méthode de couple de diffusion. La solubilité terminale pour le Zircaloy-2 et le Zircaloy-4 en dessous de 550°C a été trouvée représentée par la relation 9,9 x 104 exp(−8250/RT) ppm. Les solubilités données par cette fonction approchent les valeurs données par le zirconium non allié auquel s'applique la relation 1,61 x 105 exp(− 8950/RT) ppm, qui est le résultat combiné de neuf déterminations. La meilleure courbe qui représenterait l'ensemble des résultats pour les trois matériaux est donnée par la relation 1,2 x 105 exp(— 8550/RT). L'activité de l'hydrogène dans la phase α obtenue par la mesure du coefficient de partage dans les couples de diffusion s'est révélée varier très légèrement pour les trois matériaux dans l'intervalle de températures 329° C−769° C. Une relation moyenne P-C-T déduite des données publiées pour ces matériaux est représentée par l'équation C/P12 = 1,4 x 10−2 exp(11840/RT) at \% mm−12.
Zusammenfassung
Es wurden Untersuchungen über den Einfluss der Zusammensetzung, der Korngrösse und der Kaltbearbeitung auf die Löslichkeitsgrenzen und die thermodynamische Aktivität von Wasserstoff in α-Zirkon, Zirkaloy-2 und Zirkaloy-4 durchgeführt. Gemessen wurden Diffusionsparameter. Als Löslichkeitsgrenze in Zirkaloy-2 und in Zirkaloy-4 unterhalb 550° C wurde ein Wert von 9,9 x 104 exp (− 8250/RT) ppm bestimmt. Diese Löslichkeitsgrenze entspricht etwa derjenigen für unlegiertes Zirkon, die nach neun verschiedenen Untersuchungen zu einem Wert von 1,61 x 105 exp (− 8950/RT) bestimmt wurde. Die beste Kurve für die Löslichkeitsgrenze bei allen drei Materialien ergibt sich mit der Funktion 1,2 x 105 exp (− 8550/RT). Im Temperaturbereich von 329–796° C variiert die Aktivität von Wasserstoff in α-Zirkon nur wenig. Aus Veröffentlichungen über die genannten Materialien lässt sich eine brauchbare Beziehung zwischen Druck, Konzentration und Temperatur ableiten. Sie lautet: C/P12 = 1,4 x 10−2 exp (11840/RT) at \% mm-12.},

Diffusion data exhibited simple Arrhenius behavior between 30 and 600°C and is described with 95\% confidence byD=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Constant heating rate desorption spectra revealed three distinct trapping states with desorption energies 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, and 84.8±32.2kJ/mol.

La désorption à vitesse de chauffage constante est utilisée afin d'expliquer les effets des états de piégeage microstructural sur la diffusivité apparente de l'hydrogéne dans l'aluminium. La désorption isotherme de l'hydrogéne à partir d'échantillons cylindriques, chargés uniformément et recuits obéit à une loi d'Arrhénius simple dans un intervalle de température compris entre 30 et 600°C et est déscrite avec probabilité de 95\% par:D=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Le spectre de désorption à vitesse de chauffage constante a montré trois différents états de piégeage avec des énergies de 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, and 84.8±32.2kJ/mol. Les états de piégeage sont associés respectivement aux sites intersticiels du réseau, aux dislocations et aux lacunes. L'identification, la quantification et la compréhension du role de ces états de piégage lors des expériences de perméation et de désorption aident à expliquer la large dispersion des valeurs trouvées pour la diffusivité de l'hydrogéne dans l'aluminium.
Zusammenfassung
Diffusion und Einschluß von Wasserstoff in polykristallinem Reinstaluminium (99.999Gew.-\%) wurden mittels thermischer Desorption sowohl unter isothermen Bedingungen als auch bei konstanter Heizrate untersucht. Eine konstante Heizrate wurde eingesetzt, um die Einflüsse mikrostruktureller Einschlußzustände auf den Diffusionskoeffizienten von Wasserstoff in Aluminium zu ermitteln. Die isotherme Desorption von Wasserstoff von ausgeglühten, einheitlich geladenen, zylindrischen Proben ist durch Bulkdiffusion bestimmt. Die Diffusionsdaten zeigen einfaches Arrheniusverhalten zwischen 30 und 600°C und werden mit 95\%-iger Zuverlässigkeit beschrieben durch:D=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Die Desorptionsspektren bei konstanter Heizrate zeigten drei verschiedene Einschlußzustände mit Desorption energies von 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, und 84.8±32.2kJ/mol. Diese Einschlußstadien waren mit Zwischengitterplätzen, Versetzungen, und Leerstellen assoziert. Identifizierung, Quantifizierung und das Verstehen der Rolle dieser Einschluß zustände in Permeabilitäts- und Desorptionsexperimenten hilft, die breite Streuung der berichteten Werte des Wasserstoffdiffusionskoeffizienten in Aluminium zu erklären.},

	abstract = {A torus-shaped sail consists of a reflective membrane attached to an inflatable torus-shaped rim. The sail’s deployment from its stowed configuration is initiated by introducing inflation pressure into the toroidal rim with an attached circular flat membrane coated by heat-sensitive materials that undergo thermal desorption (TD) from a solid to a gas phase. Our study of the deployment and acceleration of the sail is split into three steps: at a particular heliocentric distance a torus-shaped sail is deployed by a gas inflated into the toroidal rim and the membrane is kept flat by the pressure of the gas; under heating by solar radiation, the membrane coat undergoes TD and the sail is accelerated via TD of coating and solar radiation pressure (SRP); when TD ends, the sail utilizes thrust only from SRP. We study the stability of the torus-shaped sail and deflection and vibration of the flat membrane due to the acceleration by TD and SRP.
A tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Because it is radioactive, its release to the environment must be minimized. Accurately predicting tritium transports in fusion materials and fusion systems heavily depend on a reliable database of hydrogen mass transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in fusion reactor materials. This article summarizes fundamental kinetics on hydrogen isotope in material and provides recommended mass transport properties (diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in materials for nuclear application.
Beryllium will be one of the plasma-facing materials for ITER. It will have to sustain high fluxes of hydrogen isotopes and as a consequence significant amounts of tritium can be retained in the wall. For safety and operational reasons, the deuterium and tritium inventory in the vacuum vessel must be limited. As a consequence, hydrogen diffusion, trapping and solubility are of vital importance in assessing and modeling the plasma fuel retention into the wall. In order to understand these issues, point defects and the behavior of hydrogen in beryllium are investigated based on Density Functional Theory calculations. Although some data have already been acquired in the past, some of them disagree, which motivates further investigations. To do so, the formation energy and diffusion properties of point defects are investigated in the first part of this paper. In a second part, the solubility and diffusivity of hydrogen in beryllium are calculated. A diffusion coefficient is established in order to be used in Rate-Equation and Kinetic Monte-Carlo Kinetic models and to allow for comparison with experimental measurements.
An effective permeation reduction of gaseous hydrogen isotopes into a metal wall by introducing a barrier is essential in two main fields: prevention of hydrogen-embrittlement in steels and control of the tritium inventory in future nuclear fusion reactors. By far the most important advances and relevant studies originate from the Nuclear Fusion Community where tritium retention is an important issue, influencing safety issues.
Stable permeation barriers are searched among materials with the lowest bulk hydrogen solubility and diffusivity. Besides a few specific pure metals, like beryllium and tungsten, dense oxides, nitrides and carbides have been mostly investigated. Coating techniques for preparation of well adhered and perfect barriers are evidently of the same importance as the material selection itself. Most attractive are the techniques where an ad-layer is formed simply by oxidation. Other methods require specific gas environments with strong electric and magnetic fields, which may represent a limit for the ad-layers uniform coverage over large and uneven areas. Evaluation of the achieved barrier performances is another challenging task. Several new methods, which can trace hydrogen isotopes in bulk at very low concentrations, often miss in the determination of their mobility. Also, they do not reveal the role of barrier defects. The classical gas permeation rate method through coated membranes is still the most reliable option to determine the actual Hydrogen Permeation Barrier (HPB) efficiency. At elevated temperature, the hydrogen permeation rate is recorded at the downstream side of a coated membrane exposed to a substantially higher hydrogen upstream pressure. By using modern vacuum instrumentation techniques, even the most effective barriers can be well characterised.
Past experiments and modeling with the Tmap code in [1, 2] indicated that Be-D co-deposited layers are less (time-wise) efficiently desorbed of retained D in a fixed low-temperature bake, as the layer grows in thickness. In Iter, beryllium rich co-deposited layers will grow in thickness over the life of the machine. Although, compared with the analyses in [1, 2], Iter presents a slightly different bake efficiency problem because of instances of prior tritium recover/control baking. More relevant to Iter, is the thermal release from a new and saturated co-deposit layer in contact with a thickness of previously-baked, less-saturated, co-deposit.
Experiments that examine the desorption of saturated co-deposited over-layers in contact with previously baked under-layers are reported and comparison is made to layers of the same combined thickness. Deposition temperatures of ∼323 K and ∼373 K are explored. It is found that an instance of prior bake leads to a subtle effect on the under-layer. The effect causes the thermal desorption of the new saturated over-layer to deviate from the prediction of the validated Tmap model in [2]. Instead of the D thermal release reflecting the combined thickness and levels of D saturation in the over and under layer, experiment differs in that, i) the desorption is a fractional superposition of desorption from the saturated over-layer, with ii) that of the combined over and under -layer thickness. The result is not easily modeled by Tmap without the incorporation of a thin BeO inter-layer which is confirmed experimentally on baked Be-D co-deposits using X-ray micro-analysis.
Samples of three industrial beryllium trademarks, such as S-200F, S-65H and I-220H are irradiated at about 40 °C to the fluence of 1.5 × 1024 m−2 (E {\textgreater} 1.15 MeV) in reactor WWR-K. On completion of irradiation tests, post irradiation examinations (PIEs) against hardness are carried out, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. Also He/T2 release properties are measured by the thermal desorption (TDS) method.
Relevant obtained values of amounts of the released tritium and helium for all samples of irradiated beryllium are in good agreement, within inaccuracy, comprising 25 ± 3 wppm for helium-4 and 1.3 ± 0.3 wppm for tritium.},

The diffusion parameters obtained for the extra-grade beryllium samples (99.8\%) are D0 = 6.7 × 10−9m2/s and ED = 28.4 kJ/mol.

A stainless steel cell formed by two independent volumes separated by a 2mm thick nickel membrane is maintained at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees Celsius. A controlled amount of T2 gas is flown in excess of argon in the source volume in contact with the bottom side of the nickel membrane, while a layer of molten salt is in contact with the top side. The tritium permeating above the liquid surface is carried by an argon flow to a diagnostic system comprised of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a gas chromatographer and a proportional counter. Tritium permeability in flibe as a function of temperature is determined by the measured permeation flow rates reached in steady-state conditions, while the diffusivity is determined by fitting the transient process with the analytical solution for the diffusion process. As a result, the solubility of tritium in flibe as a function of temperature is also determined.},

Experimental permeation measurements were performed over the temperature range 450–620 K and an interpretation of the data was attempted based on a surface-limited tritium release model. At the tritium partial pressure of 0.1 Pa present in a machine such as JET, the flow of tritium is strongly influenced by surface reactions. Furthermore, it is often assumed that oxide layers, acting as permeation barriers, are present on such components. However, for effectiveness, such barriers must be intact and this may not necessarily be the case for engineering components in which mechanical stresses can lead to oxide cracking. The recombination (σk2) and adsorption (σk1) constants of tritium were estimated for both stationary and continually flexing bellows.},

The permeation flux increased with increasing temperature above 200°C whereas it was roughly constant below 150°C. Such temperature dependence was observed for nickel and copper as well, and has been ascribed to the transition in the rate-limiting processes of the deuterium transport in the membrane. The recombination coefficient of deuterium on iron surface was evaluated from the permeation flux density. In the case of α-iron, the evaluated value agreed with a semitheoretical one estimated using literature data of adsorption probability and solubility.

We have experimentally determined mass-transfer properties by an unsteady permeation method, which data are necessary to design a system to recover tritium (T) from a Pb–Li blanket. An experiment of simultaneous H and D permeation through Li17Pb83 is performed to clarify interactions between atoms in the two-component permeation process. The experimental results are analyzed by a model of one-dimensional or two-dimensional permeation through Li17Pb83. The major permeation proceeds in the longitudinal direction of the present system, and the ratio of hydrogen leak in the radial direction is evaluated using the simulation. As a result, it was found that H and D atoms permeate independently regardless of the H/D component ratio within the present experimental conditions. The permeability and diffusivity of H are 1.4 times higher than that of D. The solubility of H is close to that of D. The isotope effect in diffusivity is in proportion to the square root of the mass ratio of D to H. When these data can be extended to the case of T, T permeability and diffusivity is predicted as 1/1.7 times lower than that of H in the temperature range from 773K to 973K.},

	abstract = {We performed an experiment of H and D permeation through Li17Pb83 in the two-component (H+D) system by an unsteady permeation method to clarify interactions between H and D atoms. It was found that H and D permeate independently regardless of the H/D composition ratio in the upstream gas. Dissolution of H and D atoms into Li17Pb83 follows the Sieverts’ law in the two-component system in a similar way to the single one. Diffusion of H and D in Li17Pb83 was the rate-determining step in the overall permeation process. An isotope effect of permeability between H and D was around 1.4 in the temperature range from 400°C to 700°C. The ratio of the isotope effect was in proportion to the square root of mass ratio of D to H. Tritium permeation can be estimated in a similar way.},

The effect of the cold-working and heat treatment conditions and the alloy composition of the materials on hydrogen permeation has been investigated. The results indicate that the permeability and diffusivity of hydrogen in various alloys obey Arrhenius relationships over the experimental temperature range and the hydrogen permeation behaviour is not significantly influenced by cold-working and heat treatment conditions of the materials but is slightly influenced by alloy composition. The difference between the hydrogen permeation behaviour of pure iron, general alloying steels and austenitic stainless steels has been discussed, and a comparison between the present work and data in the literature has been made.},

The hydrogen permeability through the aluminum alloy and its coating materials was determined by a vapor phase permeation technique at temperatures ranging from 400 to 500°C using high-purity H2 (99.9999\%) gas with an upstream hydrogen pressure of 104−105 Pa. The experimental results show that the hydrogen permeability through aluminum oxide coating is 100–2000 times lower than that through the aluminum alloy substrate. This means that the aluminum oxide is a significant hydrogen permeation barrier. A high hydrogen permeation resistance was observed in an oxide layer prefilmed in 200°C water, while an anodized aluminum oxide film had a less obstructive effect, possibly caused by the porous structure of the anodic oxide. The hydrogen permeability through films of aluminum oxide was not a simple function of the aluminum-oxide phase configuration.},

These values are higher than those estimated by several previous authors with hydrogen evolution techniques in high temperature regions.

Hydrogen was introduced by gas phase charging in the temperature range of 300-400 degrees C, and by electrochemical charging at room temperature. It was found that the diffusivity of hydrogen depends on the relative concentration of vacancies to the dissolved hydrogen concentration. The activation energy for the diffusion of hydrogen was found to be 0.61-0.62 eV at high temperatures where the concentration of vacancies was much higher than that of dissolved hydrogen. The value is near the migration energy of a vacancy in aluminium. On the other hand, at room temperature where the hydrogen showed a diffusivity considerably larger than that extrapolated from high temperatures. These facts suggest that hydrogen in aluminium migrates together with a vacancy at high temperatures due to a large binding energy between them.},

The diffusion coefficient depended linearly upon an inverse of temperature in the Arrhenius plot. There were two characteristics in the plot; one of them was a change of apparent activation energy for diffusion being a fixed diffusivity at about 900 K, while another was a correlation between the increase of activation energy and the decrease of grain size. We proposed a simple model for grain size dependence of the hydrogen diffusivity. The decrease in diffusivity at a lower temperature for the smaller grain size was explained by trapping of hydrogen at nodes of grain boundaries. In a very large grain size, there was a possibility of a fast diffusion along the grain boundary. The increase in solubility usually expected from a trapping process was not found in this study.},

	abstract = {Surface modification of tungsten due to the cooling species nitrogen seeded in the divertor region, i.e., by nitrogen ion implantation or re-deposition, is considered to affect the permeation behavior of H isotopes. This work focuses on the effect of nitrogen ion implantation into tungsten (W-N) on the deuterium gas-driven permeation behavior. For comparison, both permeation in tungsten implanted with W ion (W-W) and without implantation (pristine W) are studied. These three samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM results revealed that the W-W sample has various voids on the surface, and the W-N sample has a rough surface with pretty fine microstructures. These are different from the pristine W sample with a smooth and compact surface. The XRD patterns show the disappearance of crystallinity on both W-W and W-N sample surfaces. It indicates that the ion implantation process results in an almost complete conversion from crystalline to amorphous in the sample surfaces. The sputter-depth profiling XPS spectra show that the implanted nitrogen prefers to form a 140 nm thick tungsten nitride layer. In permeation experiments, it was found that the D permeability is temperature dependent. Interestingly, the W-N sample presented a lower D permeability than the W-W sample, but higher than the pristine W sample. Such behavior implies that tungsten nitride acts as a permeation barrier, while defects created by ions implantation can promote permeability. The possible permeation mechanism correlated with sample surface composition and microstructure is consequently discussed in this work.},

The mutual solubilities and isotopic exchange equilibria of hydrogen and deuterium in lithium have been measured at temperatures between 700 and 900°C. Both the total pressure and individual partial pressures of H2, HD, and D2 have been determined as a function of the mole fraction of LiH and LiD in the lithium solution with varying hydrogen-to-deuterium ratios. In the plateau region, the hydrogen and deuterium could be treated as a single chemical species. However, in the Sieverts region the hydrogen and deuterium dissolved independently of each other. The equilibrium isotope exchange constant, K, given by the relationship PD212/PH212 = KNLiD/NLiH varied from 1.28 at 700°C to 1.17 at 850°C.},

Knowledge of the hydrogen mass transfer mechanisms through metals is very important to the purpose of properly designing and operating the membrane reactors. With the aim of understanding the deviations from the ideal behavior of the transport mechanisms predicted by the Sieverts' law, a permeation model which takes into account the surface effects has been applied to the permeability measurements that have been carried out on dense Pd–Ag permeator tubes from 473 to 623 K. The model has been validated by the results of permeation tests in a wide range of pressure (200–800 kPa) and membrane thickness (84–200 μm). The new model modifies the Sieverts' law by introducing the mass transfer resistances due to surface effects. The values of the surface resistance and permeability calculated by the model have been compared with the literature. Finally, the new hydrogen permeation expression has been applied in order to analyze the cost of a separation system which would consist of tubular Pd-based membranes.},

We emphasized transient behavior of individual species (especially H) caused by changing catalyst temperature. Reaction rates, and equilibria derived from them, confirm Langmuir's results of 50 years ago, and disagree with more recent authors who published reaction rates 200‐fold faster. These authors did not emphasize chemical identification of both reactants and products, but attributed a measured decrease of total pressure to H, produced as in (1) and abstracted either chemically or by refrigeration. Reactions unrelated to atomization can decrease total pressure.Transient behavior above 1200°K was dominated by diffusion; this suggests that neither surface atomization mechanism usually favored is important. Our transient methods permit evaluation of parameters fundamental for diffusion and for solution of hydrogen in W or Mo, from 10—7 to 10—4 Torr, well below the range of the Fowler—Smithells theory.

The mobility of hydrogen was studied in corundum (α−Al2O3) as well as in liquid alumina. Using both static as well as molecular-dynamics calculations, and applying classical transition state theory, we derive the temperature-dependent diffusivity of hydrogen in α−Al2O3 as D(T)=(21.7×10−8m2/s)exp(−1.24eV/kT). The corresponding diffusivity of hydrogen in liquid/amorphous alumina, derived directly from ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, is D(T)=(8.71×10−7m2/s)exp(−0.91eV/kT). The computed diffusivity compares very well to experimental data. We conclude that diffusion of neutral hydrogen through the bulk of alumina is a good approximation of the mechanism for hydrogen mobility in corrosion scales. The representation of grain-boundary structures by amorphous alumina is, probably, realistic at higher temperatures.},

	abstract = {Reduced activation ferritic-martensitic (RAFM) steels have been developed for decades for use as fusion blanket structural materials, and have advantages in both mechanical properties and irradiation resistance following careful engineering of the microstructure. However, the hydrogen isotope behavior in these proposed fusion structural materials is not well understood, but is important to assess since it impacts the fusion reactor safety and self-sufficient tritium fuel cycle. In this work, we investigated deuterium transport and retention in representative advanced RAFM steels, including castable nanostructured alloys (CNAs), and oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels. A gas-driven permeation (GDP) system was used to measure the permeability, diffusivity and solubility of the studied materials, covering the temperature range from 623 K to 873 K, and the loading pressures from 1.8x104 to 1.0x105 Pa. The results indicated that the deuterium permeability has little material dependence. In contrast, the deuterium diffusivity of the studied materials showed significant variation. The deuterium diffusivity in ODS steels is one order of magnitude lower than that in RAFM steels and CNAs, and correspondingly, have an effective solubility that is 2-10 times larger than RAFM steels and CNAs. In addition, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) measurements were performed to assess the deuterium retention and desorption of these materials following a static thermal deuterium charging at 723 Kfor 1 hour under the deuterium pressure of 1.0x105Pa. It was found that ODS steels exhibit the highest deuterium retention and have broader desorption peaks. Microstructural features contributing to deuterium retention and impacting deuterium transport are discussed to rationalize the observed deuterium behavior in the studied RAFM steels.}

Compared with traditional zirconium alloy fuel cladding, increased tritium permeation through FeCrAl fuel cladding to the primary coolant is expected, raising potential safety concerns. In this study, the hydrogen permeability of several FeCrAl alloys was obtained using a static permeation test station, which was calibrated and validated using 304 stainless steel. The high hydrogen permeability of FeCrAl alloys leads to concerns with respect to potentially significant tritium release when used for fuel cladding in LWRs. The total tritium inventory inside the primary coolant of a light water reactor was quantified by applying a 1-dimensional steady state tritium diffusion model to demonstrate the dependence of tritium inventory on fuel cladding type. Furthermore, potential mitigation strategies for tritium release from FeCrAl fuel cladding were discussed and indicate the potential for application of an alumina layer on the inner clad surface to serve as a tritium barrier. More effort is required to develop a robust, economical mitigation strategy for tritium permeation in reactors using FeCrAl clad fuel assemblies.}

Gas driven permeation experiments were performed. The permeability of the oxidized FeCrAl steel was obtained and a reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel CLF-1 was used as a comparison. In order to characterize the oxide layer, SEM, XPS, TEM, HRTEM were used. Al2O3 was detected in the oxide film by XPS, and HRTEM showed that Al2O3 in the α phase was found. The formation of α-Al2O3 layer at a relatively low temperature may result from the formation of Cr2O3 nuclei.}
